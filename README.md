## Introduction

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game board is a 3x3 grid, and players take turns marking a cell with 'X' or 'O'. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
